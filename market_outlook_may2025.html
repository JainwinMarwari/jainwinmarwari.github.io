    <h2>Macro Trends Impacting Small Caps</h2>
    <p>May 2025 brings a unique macroeconomic environment where small caps are gaining momentum. With inflation moderating and interest rate cuts on the horizon, capital is flowing back into growth-centric small cap names. Domestic consumption remains strong, aided by rural recovery and lower fuel prices.</p>

    <p>At Jainwin Marwari, we’re focused on identifying fundamentally strong businesses that will benefit most from these cyclical tailwinds. In this piece, we’ll walk through a few sectors that excite us right now and share how we’re positioning for the next few quarters.</p>

    <h3>Favorable Sectors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Capital Goods</strong>: Strong order books driven by private capex.</li>
      <li><strong>Consumer Discretionary</strong>: Rural consumption rebound.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial Services</strong>: Well-capitalized NBFCs gaining share in Tier 2/3 cities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We continue to believe in bottom-up stock picking while keeping macro as a guide—not a driver. The goal is steady compounding, not chasing momentum.</p>

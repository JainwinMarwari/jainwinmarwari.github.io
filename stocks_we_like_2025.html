    <h2>High Conviction Ideas (May 2025)</h2>

    <p>At Jainwin Marwari, we follow a rigorous process for identifying high-conviction stocks that can deliver strong compounding over 3–5 years. Here are three we’re particularly excited about this quarter:</p>

    <h3>1. Prudent FinServe Ltd</h3>
    <p>An emerging NBFC with clean books, excellent capital adequacy, and strong growth in Tier 3/4 lending markets. Projected CAGR: 22%.</p>

    <h3>2. Zenith Engineering Works</h3>
    <p>A niche capital goods manufacturer with strong operating leverage, improving margins, and global expansion underway. Projected CAGR: 20–22%.</p>

    <h3>3. Namma Retail Tech</h3>
    <p>Consumer tech firm combining physical retail presence with digital capabilities. Strong brand pull and expanding margins. Projected CAGR: 25%+.</p>

    <p>These are not recommendations but ideas we’re actively researching and tracking. Allocation decisions are made after risk calibration and ongoing review.</p>
